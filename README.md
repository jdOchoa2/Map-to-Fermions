# Mapping to Free Fermions
This repository contains code to solve a spin-1/2 random antiferromagnetic XX chains using mapping to free fermions and exact diagonalization.

## Running the simulation

To run the main part of the code:

```bash
make
```
This will produce .txt files with the disorder-averaged zz correlation function.

## Plotting

To plot the results, first install matplotlib and numpy with:

```bash
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```
